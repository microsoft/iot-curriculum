# Set up IoT Central and the Raspberry Pi to send humidity and sound data

In the previous step you either [set up a Raspberry Pi](./set-up-pi.md), or [set up a virtual IoT device](./set-up-virtual-pi.md) to send temperature data.

In this step you will set up IoT Central to receive humidity and sound data.

## Set up the new telemetry values in IoT Central

The *Environment Monitor* device template has an interface that can receive temperature telemetry values. This template needs to be changed to handle more values. Interfaces on device templates are immutable - that is they can't be changed, but templates support versioning, so you can add a new version to the template with a new interface version that can handle the new values.

### Version the device template

1. Open the IoT Central app

1. Select **Device Templates** from the side bar menu

    ![The device templates menu](../../../images/iot-central-menu-device-templates.png)

1. Select the **Environment Monitor** device template from the list

    ![The device templates list](../images/iot-central-device-templates-list-env-monitor.png)

1. Select the **Version** button to create a new version of the device template

    ![the version button](../images/iot-central-device-templates-version-button.png)

1. Leave the name of the new version as the default in the *New device template version* dialog, and select **Create**

    ![The new version dialog](../images/iot-central-device-templates-new-version-dialog.png)

### Version the interface

To add new telemetry values, a new version of the interface needs to be created with the new capabilities.

1. Select the **Environment** interface from the sidebar

    ![The device template sidebar](../images/iot-central-environment-monitor-template-interfaces.png)

1. Select the **Version** button to create a new version of the interface

    ![The version button](../images/iot-central-interface-version-button.png)

1. From the *New interface version* dialog, select **Create**

    ![The new interface version dialog](../images/iot-central-device-templates-interface-new-version-dialog.png)

1. The new interface will be created with a single capability - *Temperature*. This is copied from the previous version of the interface, and is greyed out and read-only.

### Add the new capabilities

1. In the capabilities list, select **+ Add capability** to add a new capability

    ![The add capability button](../images/iot-central-interface-add-capability-button.png)

1. Set the following details for the new capability:

    | Display Name | Name     | Capability Type | Semantic Type | Schema | Unit |
    | ------------ | -------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------ | ---- |
    | Humidity     | Humidity | Telemetry       | Humidity      | Double | %    |

    ![The new humidity capability](../images/iot-central-interface-new-humidity-capability.png)

1. Repeat the above steps to add a new capability for sound:

    | Display Name | Name  | Capability Type | Semantic Type | Schema | Unit |
    | ------------ | ----- | --------------- | ------------- | ------ | ---- |
    | Sound        | Sound | Telemetry       | None          | Double | None |

    ![The new sound capability](../images/iot-central-interface-new-sound-capability.png)

1. Select the **Save** button

    ![The save button](../images/iot-central-interface-save-capability-button.png)

### Create new view

The current view for the device only shows Temperature, so to show humidity and sound, new views need to be created.

1. From the *Environment Monitor* device template, select **Views**

    ![The views menu](../images/iot-central-device-templates-views-menu.png)

1. Select **Visualizing the device** to add a new view to visualize data from a device

    ![The new view option buttons](../images/iot-central-device-templates-new-view-options.png)

1. Name the view `Humidity`

    ![Naming the view](../images/iot-central-device-templates-new-view-name-humidity.png)

1. Check **Humidity** in the *Telemetry* section, and select **Add tile**

    ![Adding the humidity tile](../images/iot-central-device-templates-new-view-tile-humidity.png)

1. Drag the bottom corner to resize the tile to the size you want

1. Select the cog button to adjust the properties for the tile

    ![The cog button](../images/iot-central-device-templates-view-tile-humidity-cog.png)

1. Change the *Display range* to be `Last 100 values`, and select the **Update** button

    ![Configuring the chart](../images/iot-central-device-templates-view-tile-humidity-configure.png)

1. Select the **Save** button

    ![The save button](../images/iot-central-device-templates-view-save-button.png)

1. Repeat the above process to create a view for the Sound telemetry value

### Publish the template

Once the new device template version is complete, it needs to be published before it can be used by a device.

1. From the device template, select the **Publish button** on the top menu

    ![The publish button](../images/iot-central-device-templates-publish-button.png)

1. Select **Publish** from the *Publish this device template* dialog

    ![The publish dialog](../images/iot-central-device-templates-publish-dialog.png)

### Migrate the devices to the new template

When a new device template version is created, all devices using the old version remain using the old version - they are not automatically migrated as the hardware may not support the new version. To use the new version, existing devices have to be manually migrated.

1. Select the **Devices** tab from the side bar menu

1. Check the box next to the *Pi Environment monitor* and the *Simulated environment monitor* in the devices list

    ![Selecting the devices](../images/iot-central-devices-select-device.png)

1. Select the **Migrate** button

    ![The migrate button](../images/iot-central-devices-device-migrate-button.png)

1. Select `Environment Monitor v2` in the *Migrate* dialog, then select the *Migrate* button

    ![The migrate dialog](../images/iot-central-devices-device-migrate-dialog.png)

1. A notification bar will pop up and show the progress, indicating when the devices have been migrated

    ![The migration progress](../images/iot-central-devices-device-migrate-progress.png)

You will now see the devices with the new device template. Selecting them will allow you to see the new views. The *Temperature* view will show the existing data, and the new *Humidity* and *Sound* views will show **Waiting for data** for the Pi as the Pi isn't sending this telemetry yet. After a few minutes you will see simulated data for the simulated device.

### Update the dashboard

The dashboard was configured to show the devices from the *All Devices* device group with the *Environment Monitor* device template, not the new *Environment Monitor v2* template. It needs to be configured to show data from this new template. This is done by updating the device group to include the devices with the new template.

1. Select the **Device groups** tab from the side bar menu

    ![The device groups menu](../../../images/iot-central-menu-device-groups.png)

1. Select the *All Devices* device group

    ![The all devices group](../images/iot-central-device-groups-all-devices-group.png)

1. Currently the device group is set up to filter all devices that use the `Environment Monitor` template. This needs to be updated to the `v2` version of this template. Drop down the *Value* box in the *Scopes* section and select `Environment Monitor v2`

    ![Selecting the v2 template](../images/iot-central-device-groups-value-v2.png)

1. You can validate the devices that will be in this group by selecting the **Run query** button

    ![The run query button](../images/iot-central-device-groups-run-query-button.png)

    When you run this, you will see all the simulated and physical device appear in the results list.

1. Save the changes by selecting the **Save** button.

    ![The save button](../images/iot-central-device-groups-save-button.png)

1. Select the **Dashboard** tab from the side bar menu

You should now see the dashboard showing the data from the simulated and physical devices - it was already configured with the two devices from the device group, so updating the device group will fix the dashboard.

### Add the new fields to the dashboard

The new humidity and sound values also need to be shown on the dashboard.

1. Select the **Dashboard** tab from the side bar menu

1. Select the **Edit** button from the top menu

    ![the edit dashboard button](../images/iot-central-dashboard-edit-button.png)

1. From the **Edit dashboard** panel in the **Add a tile** section, drop down the *Device group* list, and select `Environment Monitor v2 - All devices`

    ![The device groups dropdown](../images/iot-central-dashboard-add-tile-device-dropdown.png)

1. Drop down the *Devices* list and select both devices

    ![The add devices dropdown](../images/iot-central-dashboard-add-tile-devices-dropdown.png)

1. Check the `Humidity` telemetry value

    ![Selecting the humidity telemetry option](../images/iot-central-dashboard-add-tile-telemetry-humidity.png)

1. Select the **Add tile** button

    ![The add tile button](../images/iot-central-dashboard-add-tile-button.png)

The humidity tile will be placed on the dashboard. Have a play with the tile size, position, and the tile properties available from the cog button. Configure the chart for the last 100 values to match the temperature tile.

![The humidity tile](../images/iot-central-dashboard-humidity-tile.png)

Repeat the steps above for the sound telemetry value. If you prefer, you can also configure multiple telemetry values on the same chart, for example to see humidity and temperature values at the same time to look for correlations.

1. Once you have finished adjusting the dashboard, select the **Save** button

    ![The save button](../images/iot-central-dashboard-temperature-tile-edit-save-button.png)
